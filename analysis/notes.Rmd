```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## TO DO
1. Examine peak length distribution
iN_Dopa iN_GABA iN_Glut    iPSC     NPC 
  0.002%   0.008%   0.000%  0.005%   0.001% 
  
  
```{r cars}
f<-fread("~/cluster/data/features/formatted/asoc_science2020/CDTS_5per_overlap_0.2_full.txt")
#check for the proportion of CDTS bins that overlap with OCR peaks with overly large lengths
unlist(lapply(split(f[f$diff>5000,], f[f$diff>5000,]$V5), function(i){length(unique(i$V1))/counts_5per}))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
