## Gene mapping strategy

### co-accessibility analysis

A method developed to identify enhancer-targeted genes
Inputs for Cicero:

1. A is a m by n input matrix of binary accessibility values, where $A_{mn}$ is zero if no read overlapping peak m in cell n and one otherwise. 
2. The Coordinates of the cells in t-SNP map or a pseudotemporal ordering of the cells along a developmental trajectory (Monocle 2)

Algorithms:
![graphic overview of the algorithm](assets/Cicero_algorithm.png)

1. Group cells with high similarity and then aggregate binary profiles into integer counts
2. Adjust counts for technical factors
3. Compute raw covariances between each pair of sites within overlapping windows. Within each window, Cicero estimates a regularized correlation matrix using the graphical LASSO. The goal is to penalize pairs of distant sites more than proximal sites.
4. Overlapping covariance matrices are processed to produce a single estimate of the co-accessibility across groups of cells.
